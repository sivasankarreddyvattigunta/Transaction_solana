# Solana SOL Transfer Example

This is a simple example of how to transfer SOL (Solana's native cryptocurrency) between two accounts using the Solana Web3.js library. The example includes code for generating key pairs, requesting an airdrop of SOL, creating and signing a transaction, and sending the transaction.

## Prerequisites

Before running this example, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js installed (https://nodejs.org/)
- NPM (Node Package Manager) installed
- Basic knowledge of Solana blockchain and cryptocurrency concepts

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/solana-sol-transfer.git
   cd solana-sol-transfer
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the `index.js` file in a text editor.

2. Locate the `DEMO_FROM_SECRET_KEY` variable and replace its value with your own secret key.

3. Save the file.

4. Run the example:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will execute the `transferSol` function, which will perform the SOL transfer.

## Important Notes

- This is a simplified example and should not be used for production purposes without additional security measures and optimizations.

- Ensure that you're using this code on the Solana Devnet (development network) for testing and learning purposes. Do not use real SOL on a live network without caution.
